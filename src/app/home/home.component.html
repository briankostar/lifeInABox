<h1>Life In A Box</h1>

<p>demo. life in weeks</p>

<!--component that takes 'minutes', 'hours', 'days', 'weeks', 'months', 'years' as argument and build a box chart-->
<!--scaling is an issue.. 356 * 90 will be a problem. having fake scroll with replaced dom nodes seems to the the only way but will need research-->
